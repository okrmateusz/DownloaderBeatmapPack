# DownloaderBeatmapPack
@TODO: write readme.md and errors or something idk.

The application is in ALPHA version, so it may have many bugs and problems. In feature updates I will make better visual components and more editable stuff.

With this application, you can easily download many beatmap packages from the osu website.
